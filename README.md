# Code Academy Parcel Service (CAPS)

A real-time service that allows for vendors, such as flower shops or restaurants, to alert a system of a package needing to be delivered, for drivers to instantly see whatâ€™s in their pickup queue, and then to alert the vendors as to the state of the deliveries (in transit, and then delivered).
